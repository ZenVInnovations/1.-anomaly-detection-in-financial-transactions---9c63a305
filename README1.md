Subject: Request for GitHub Repository Access

Good evening Ma’am,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m writing on behalf of my project team—Charithra and myself to let you know that although we’ve both completed our assigned phases, I haven’t yet been granted upload access to the shared GitHub repository.

Here are the details:

* GitHub username: Neha2harnal

* Repository URL (team):insert  our team repo URL here
* Personal repository (completed work):* [https://github.com/Neha2harnal/Anamoly\_detection](https://github.com/Neha2harnal/Anamoly_detection)

I’ve already tried forking and opening a pull request, and I’ve checked the IBM/Rooman portal my name still appears as “not accepted” in the team details. I also sent an earlier email but may have missed your response.

Could you please grant my GitHub account push access to the shared repository? Once I have the proper permissions, I’ll upload our completed tasks right away.

Warm regards,
Neha Harnal/Charithra
